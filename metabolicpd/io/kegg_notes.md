# KGML File

## Useful parts so far
- file.compounds gives a list of entries of type compound
    - names look like `cpd:######` which correspond to kegg compounds.
- file.reactions gives a list of reactions which contains reversability, products, and substrates
    - names look like `rn:######` which correspond to kegg reactions
    - NOTE I DON'T THINK THIS INCLUDES UBEREDGES
